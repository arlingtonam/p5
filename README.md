## 📁_Project boiler
```index.html``` is a template for an HTML file. This index.html first imports the libraries included in the folder (p5.js, p5.sound.js) then loads and executes the file sketch.js which is where you can write your own code.

```sketch.js``` is a template for the p5.js sketch, with the functions setup() and draw() that you can complete.

```script.js```  and ```style.css``` are for extra styling and functionality if needed

## Vite Configuration

This project uses [Vite](vite.config.js) as a development server and build tool. The configuration is set up to:

- Run the development server on port 3000
- Automatically open the browser when you start the server

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:3000` where you can view your p5.js sketches.
